Anne Feeney is an award winning activist folk song-writer and singer. Anne performs music designed to “comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.” Over her 35 year performing and recording career she has spent her waking hours with people who are trying to make a difference in this world: people on strike, or in a union or community organizing drive, or defending women's rights, the environment, human rights... working to end poverty and racism and teaching peace. Anne has toured North America and Europe playing thousands of shows, released 12 recordings, and wrote the classic protest song “Have You Been to Jail For Justice” made popular by Peter, Paul, & Mary and featured in several films. She received the Joe Hill award from the Labor Heritgage Foundaton in 2005.

I couldn't find any work.  And it looks like my<br>colleagues are also unemployed this Labor Day Weekend.  What's<br>happening to labor culture???<br><br>You would think that in such a crucial election year that labor would be taking advantage of Labor Day to present cultural events coast to coast that tell Labor's vision, history and values.<br><br>The best idea I've seen for the future of labor comes from my friend<br>Tom Geoghegan --<br><br>Six words could change the future for organized labor... find out<br>what they are at:<br><br><a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_9988069\">http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_9988069</a><br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br><br><br>DID YOU KNOW...<br><br><br>Did you know that when you buy one of my CDs on CDBaby they send me a<br>cute email that says: Break out the Champagne!! Look who just bought a<br>copy of &quot;Dump the Bosses Off Your Back!&quot; (or &quot;Union Maid&quot; or &quot;If I<br>Can't Dance&quot; or &quot;Heartland&quot; or &quot;Look to the Left&quot; ... you get the<br>idea..)  and it gives me your name, info, and any message you've left<br>for me.  It's so exciting and such a lift to get those emails! I love<br>it!!<br><br>So please, go to <a href=\"http://cdbaby.com/all/unionmaid\">http://cdbaby.com/all/unionmaid</a> and get one of my<br>CDs for yourself, or as a gift for the working class hero in your<br>life.  Put some labor culture into your Labor Day celebrations.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>SWEDISH PRESS<br><br>Since my arrival in Sweden I've had a dozen or more press interviews<br>and reviews... (here's a link to a nice one about a wonderful<br>festival I played in Skellefte&#xE5; -- 700 miles north of Stockholm --<br>just a couple hours south of the Arctic Circle.)<br><br><a href=\"http://norran.se/noje/article144681.ece\">http://norran.se/noje/article144681.ece</a><br><br>The one that made me laugh out loud was a story where the (very)<br>young reporter asked me to describe my music.  I replied that it was<br>very much in the spirit of Pete Seeger.  Her face was blank.  So I<br>wrote down his name for her and suggested that she look him up.  I<br>told her a little bit about Pete and his music and his work.<br>Apparently she didn't have time to look him up. The next day the<br>article said, &quot;When I asked her to describe her music, she said that<br>she sounds like an 89 year old man who is still performing.&quot;<br><br>BOOKS<br><br>I'm reading Les Leopold's wonderful biography of Tony Mazzochi - The<br>Man Who Hated Work and Loved Labor: The Life and Times of Tony<br>Mazzochi.  God how I miss Tony Mazzochi - a real visionary.<br><br>And as soon as I've finished it, I'm ordering<br><br>Steve Ellner.  Rethinking Venezuelan Politics: Class, Conflict, and<br>the Chavez Phenomenon.   Boulder and London: Lynne Rienner, 2008 from<br>Powell's Books. <br><br>There is so much crazy stuff being written about Hugo Chavez, but Kim<br>Scipes' thoughtful review<br><a href=\"http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/scipes170708.html\">http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/scipes170708.html</a> convinced me this<br>is the book I want to read about what's going on in Venezuela -- and<br>South America.<br><br>The Shock Doctrine is out in paperback now.

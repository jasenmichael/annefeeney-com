Please know that I stand by to offer support for this struggle in any way that you might suggest.<br><br>If you have flyers about the strike that have the name and address of the strike fund I will be happy to distribute them at my shows for as long as the strike continues. In the next six weeks I will be performing in Philadelphia, San Diego, Detroit, Boston, Providence, Toronto, Atlanta and Jacksonville and it will be my privilege to share your struggle with my audiences. I will also be passing the hat at each up my<br>upcoming concerts.<br><br>In the course of my travels I will seek out your members' picket lines and stop by to offer encouragement and support. Please send literature about the strike that I may pass out at my concerts to: 7206 Michigan Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15218 - or I can come downtown and pick up material if that is more convenient. Call me at 412.877.6480 if you want me to come get materials.<br><br>Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes -<br><br>In solidarity<br><br>Anne Feeney<br>AFM Locals 60-471 and 1000<br>CLUW\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>",

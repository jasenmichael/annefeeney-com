Kerrville Folk Festival pal <a href=\"http://kengaines.com\">Ken Gaines</a> was in from Houston, Texas to join in the festivities.  He and I are getting ready to cut Pete's cake <img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/enobtjsQ459AYkNzxltpxa623QNv0_hyldIa0f6t_NmLCXmIk-mAjPeI-gyAB56YuM6XXbqQy5mlrTncfx0=s0-d\"> We collected $250 for the Hudson River Clearwater Sloop. Also singing that evening were John Hayes and Jack Erdie. <img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/HxiJsumBITypgQRbh04CQF98yPr0bIQDgIO-qLOWLjpjYpVJv4mFf8e2DreHPf8Ke35yRQO8OYBkZeyg=s0-d\">  It was a great evening.  People joined in on &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot; (Tom DeLay's name never came up.....), &quot;Wimoweh,&quot; &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot; and many others.  It was part of a <a href=\"http://seegerfest.com\">celebration</a> intended to stretch from the redwood forests to the Gulfstream waters ... and I think it did.  Happy birthday, Pete!\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>",

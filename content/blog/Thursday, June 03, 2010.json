Tom Pigott and I met at the Kerrville Folk Festival over Memorial Day weekend and had a terrific time planning the exciting details of the upcoming tours. We'll have a complete itinerary available for you soon... but the trips are going to be absolutely sensational!<br>\n<br>\nAugust 10-19th is Clare, Kerry and Cork<br>\nAugust 22-31st is Dublin, Belfast, Derry and Donegal<br>\n<br>\nIf you'd like some information, please email me at anne@annefeeney.com and I'll send it off to you. I'd *love* to go to Ireland with you, and these trips which I arrange in conjunction with Tom Pigott of Enchanted Way Tours are just about the best way you could ever see the Emerald Isle... <a href=\"http://enchantedwaytours.ie/\">http://enchantedwaytours.ie/</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #20124d;\"><strong>FOSSIL FOOLS</strong></span><br>\n<br>\nMy sister Kathleen sent me an eloquent summary of what's going on:<br>\n<br>\n&quot;I watch the plume of greed that looks unstoppable. Mother earth is hemorrhaging and I am afraid the doctors cannot help her. I grieve for those beautiful reefs and waters where I've had so much fun. I sit on the couch and cry. I hate BP and I cry. I could not believe that they did not cancel the Indie 500 gas-burning waste .. it was such a strange experience to hit the remote .. see oil killing the earth and then watch the Indie .. and then watch one wasteful air stunt show after other to &quot;Celebrate America&quot; ... Blue Angels gushing fuel lines in the sky to amuse people .. ughhh&quot;<br>\n<br>\nAnd BP is allowed to supervise its own cleanup?? It's like asking the Mafia to do something about organized crime. This video contains some pretty salty language, but the common sense of the argument advanced really gives us something to think about as we watch the cleanup of the Gulf.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8kMXufu3w\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8kMXufu3w</a><br>\n<br>\nFAIR had a great summary of the oil industry PR blitz leading up to the last round of offshore drilling permits...<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=4079\">http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=4079</a><br>\n<br>\nThere has to be a better way... and it's going to require some massive rethinking by our planet's leaders ... It's not just the Gulf of Mexico, and it's not just BP..<br>\n<br>\nHere's a compelling story about an ongoing (and worse) environmental catastrophe in Nigeria...<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/30/oil-spills-nigeria-niger-delta-shell\">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/30/oil-spills-nigeria-niger-delta-shell</a><br>\n<br>\nAnd look what Chevron/Texaco has done to Ecuador.<br>\n<a href=\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MBJnnk6bBo\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MBJnnk6bBo</a><br>\n<br>\nHow bad does this stuff have to get before people finally realize that the guys in charge *really* don't know what they're doing???<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>FAMILY NEWS</strong></span><br>\n<br>\nI've got my ticket to go visit Dan and Monique after their son in born in Quito in late August/early September. I'm sooooooo excited!<br>\n<br>\nI'm spending most of the 18 day Kerrville Folk Festival camping with my daughter Amy. Kerrville is always such a joyful reunion with friends from all over ... It's particularly wonderful this year, since I'm booked to perform on Tuesday, June 8th! And, to add to the joy, I'm splitting the evening with Chris Chandler and Paul Benoit!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/_yPZWeXAMdds/TAgBfrhuT7I/AAAAAAAAAjE/Sm2xUFAKPeo/s1600/31079_399137723892_616588892_4331567_7593176_n.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" gu=\"true\" src=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/_yPZWeXAMdds/TAgBfrhuT7I/AAAAAAAAAjE/Sm2xUFAKPeo/s320/31079_399137723892_616588892_4331567_7593176_n.jpg\"></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br>\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">Here's a photo by Neale Eckstein of me, Eric Schwartz and Ronnie Cox at KFF</div><br>\nIn the April Fellow Travelers' Advisory I showed you my husband, Julie Leonardsson's new painting in its very early stage....

Although we have built organizations that push forward an integrated, multi-issue, multiracial strategy, we have yet to build our movement on a scale relative to our sisters and brothers in the Global South. The USSF II offers the opportunity to continue to gather and unify these growing forces. We must seize this moment and advance our collective work to build grassroots leadership, develop collective vision, and formulate strategies that keep a strong movement growing. There are many ways to get involved. Your organization can join the NPC, you can join the working groups or start building regional and local committees to ensure a massive and diverse participation in Detroit, June 22-26, 2010.

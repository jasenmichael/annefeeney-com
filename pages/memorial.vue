          In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the Anne Feeney
          Hellraiser Fund, managed by the Labor Heritage Foundation
        </p>

          Anne Feeney was “the best labor singer in North America,” according to
          Utah Phillips, “a fearless and formidable force,” according to Rage
          Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, and “rocked the house”
          according to Dar Williams. She was also a mentor who generously gave
          her time and support to help jump-start the careers of many young and
          up-and-coming songwriters, activists, and artists who carry on the
          tradition of using music and art as a tool and a weapon in support of
          movements for social, economic, and environmental justice. She
          especially supported young women, queer and trans artists, working
          class artists and artists of color by sharing her wisdom, her
          contacts, and the stage. The Anne Feeney Hell Raiser Fund is a fund
          managed through the Labor Heritage Foundation that will carry on
          Anne’s work of constantly passing the torch and lifting up the voices
          of emerging activist musicians. Each year the fund will provide small
          grants to artists carrying forward Anne Feeney’s rabble rousing
          legacy. Grants between $500 - 1,000 will be used to support a
          recording project, subsidize a tour, or support in the creation of
          original music or artwork that comforts the afflicted and afflicts the
          comfortable. Funds raised will first cover burial costs, and then will
          be split between the memorial fund and the Labor Heritage Foundation.
          To apply for the grant, send an email with a one-paragraph description
          of your work and the project you need funding for, as well as a link
          to your work, to annefeeneymemorial@gmail.com
